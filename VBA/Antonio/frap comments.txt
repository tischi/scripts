- the ERES can only be detected as spots within a z-range of 4*0.3um=1.2um, independent of the pinhole
	- this makes sense as the excitation PSF becomes blurry outside this range
- it seems that opening the pinhole to 2.4um provides a quite even sum intensity measurement within this 1.2 um range
	- thus, it does not make sense to open the pinhole even more?!
	- TODO: check how the top-hat filter affects this! a too small filter will make it worse, because the ERES will be subtracted from itself if it become too blurry

- zstack during FRAP:
	- works with CENTER
	- dz = 0.8um is good value, given the excitation PSF of the NA1.4 63x oil lens (see above)
	- however when the imaging is fast (<100ms), using the piezo seems to be inaccurate, i.e. the center plane is not in the center
	- for big dz=4um (nz=3) the piezo was loosing it completely, stage behaved fine
	- the stage is precise no matter what the speed is, but then the total acquisition time is longer
	
=> use stage if possible, easier and more accurate!
